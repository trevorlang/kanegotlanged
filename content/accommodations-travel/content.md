Trevor and Jackie’s love story began in May 2009, in Ashburn, VA, at the most romantic setting anyone could ever imagine: Red Robin. Jackie had just moved back to Northern VA after having graduated from JMU, and Trevor was still in school, studying to be become a graphic designer. At the time, both were servers at the restaurant. 

On Jackie’s first day back at work, they met, and the attraction was immediate. Jackie gave Trevor a stack of crumpled up coasters and Trevor gave Jackie a bracelet he may or may not have stolen from a child. He even asked her to split sliders with him in good ol’ booth # 71 after work one night. Obviously there was something special there, as every beautiful romance blossoms over a basket of bottomless steak fries. 

One night, a few people from work decided to go bowling, so Jackie and Trevor decided to join. After a couple drinks at TGI Friday’s, Jackie asked Trevor to hang out a little longer before going home. They sat in the car in the bowling alley parking lot talking for hours, before Trevor finally made his move, and kissed her. One week later, they were officially a couple.

Jackie and Trevor’s love for travel, wineries, concerts, hiking, cheering on their favorite sports teams, Disney movies, and above all else, each other, led to many amazing adventures in the coming years. In January 2018, they moved to Colorado, where they currently reside with their crazy but lovable dogs, Bucky and Verna. 

And finally, on December 27, 2018, after 9 and a half wonderful years together, Trevor proposed to Jackie in the same bowling alley parking lot where they first started falling in love. 

Jackie and Trevor are SO excited to share their special day with all of their friends and family, and can’t wait to spend the rest of their lives together!
