Two room blocks have been reserved for the wedding, with both hotels approximately 10 minutes from the venue. Jackie & Trevor will be staying at the Holiday Inn, and the more party-prone are encouraged to do the same. The party will likely continue there well after the reception. The room block discounts are available up to three days before and after the wedding if you would like to spend some more time checking out the area. The morning after the wedding, join us between 9-11am for light refreshments in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites
Front Royal Blue Ridge Shadows.
