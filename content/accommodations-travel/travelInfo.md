###Things to do
There's plenty to do around Front Royal if you have time while you're in town. Some of our favorites near by include Blue Ridge Shadows Golf Club, Charlestown Casino, Fox Meadows Winery, Front Royal Brewing, Shenandoah River State Park, Skyline Drive, and Luray Caverns.

###Venue Transportation
On the big day, transportation to and from the venue will be available for those staying at either of the suggested hotels. We encourage anyone staying at either hotel to make use of the transportation so you are free to let loose... _\*cough\* open bar \*cough\*_. We will update this page with the transportation schedule prior to the wedding.

### Travel Information
For those traveling from out of town, Washington Dulles International will likely be your best option.
